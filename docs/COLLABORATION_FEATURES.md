# SprintSync Collaboration Features

This document provides an overview of the collaboration features implemented in SprintSync, transforming it from an individual task manager into a team-based sprint planning tool.

## Overview

SprintSync now supports project-based collaboration, task assignment, and team visibility while maintaining backward compatibility with existing individual tasks.

## Key Features

### 1. Project Management
- Create and manage projects with descriptions and active status
- Project ownership with clear ownership boundaries
- Project-level statistics and progress tracking

### 2. Team Collaboration
- Add/remove team members to projects
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member)
- Task assignment to specific team members
- Team member management interface

### 3. Enhanced Task Management
- Filter tasks by project
- View task assignee information
- Project-level task statistics
- Cross-project task visibility for admins

### 4. Administrative Capabilities
- System-wide task management for administrators
- User management dashboard
- Project oversight across all teams
- Cross-project analytics and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Database Models**: Project and ProjectMember tables with proper relationships
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for project and membership management
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control with global admin privileges
- **Task Enhancements**: Project context support in existing task endpoints

### Frontend
- **Project Dashboard**: Main interface for project management
- **Project Details**: Comprehensive view with tasks and members
- **Task Views**: Enhanced filtering and assignment capabilities
- **Admin Panel**: System-wide management and analytics

## Components

### Pages
1. **DashboardPage** - Feature overview and navigation
2. **ProjectsPage** - Main project management interface
3. **ProjectDetailsPage** - Project-specific view with tasks and members
4. **TasksPage** - Enhanced task management with project filtering
5. **AdminDashboardPage** - System administration panel

### Components
1. **ProjectCreationModal** - Create new projects
2. **MemberManagementModal** - Add/remove project members
3. **TaskAssignmentModal** - Assign tasks to team members
4. **UserManagementPanel** - Admin user management
5. **ProjectAnalyticsPanel** - Cross-project analytics

## API Endpoints

### Project Management
- `POST /projects/` - Create new project
- `GET /projects/` - List user's projects
- `GET /projects/{project_id}` - Get project details
- `PUT /projects/{project_id}` - Update project (admins+)
- `DELETE /projects/{project_id}` - Delete project (owners only)

### Project Membership
- `POST /projects/{project_id}/members` - Add member to project (admins+)
- `GET /projects/{project_id}/members` - List project members
- `DELETE /projects/{project_id}/members/{user_id}` - Remove member (admins+, not owners)

### Enhanced Task Endpoints
- Modified existing task endpoints to support project context
- Added filtering by project_id
- Added assignment functionality

## Security

### Permission System
- **Global Admin (isAdmin)**: System-wide privileges
- **Project Roles**: OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER with appropriate permissions
- **Task Visibility**: Context-aware visibility based on project membership
- **API Security**: Authentication and authorization for all endpoints

## Migration

### Database Changes
- Added Project and ProjectMember tables
- Updated tasks table with project_id and assigned_to_id foreign keys
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing tasks

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing individual tasks remain fully accessible
- Default project creation for existing users
- Maintained current API functionality where possible

## Performance

### Optimizations
- Efficient database queries for project/task relationships
- Proper indexing on foreign keys
- Pagination for large result sets

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with external tools
- Mobile application
- Notification system
- Advanced project planning features (Gantt charts, roadmaps)

## Conclusion

SprintSync has been successfully transformed into a collaborative team sprint planning tool that supports both individual task management and team-based software engineering workflows. The implementation maintains the simplicity of the original tool while adding powerful collaboration features for teams of all sizes.
